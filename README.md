<h1> Whereby API</h1>1>
The code is a Node.js application that creates a RESTful API for managing meetings. It defines a few routes for creating and retrieving meetings using MongoDB for persistence and the Whereby API for generating unique meeting room URLs.

Here is a brief overview of what the code does:
<ul>
<li> Import necessary modules - Express, Mongoose, and fetch </li>
<li> Connect to the MongoDB instance on port 27017 </li>
<li> Define a meeting schema for storing meeting details in the database </li>
<li> Create a model for the Meeting schema </li>
<li> Define an async function called getMeetingRoomUrl() to fetch a unique meeting room URL from the Whereby API </li>
<li> Define a route to create a new meeting (/meetings) using the HTTP POST method </li>
<li> In the route handler, call getMeetingRoomUrl() to fetch a unique meeting room URL from Whereby API </li>
<li> Create a new Meeting instance using the request body and the meeting room URL fetched from the API </li>
<li> Save the new meeting to the database using the save() method </li>
<li> Return a success response with the created meeting object and HTTP status 201 </li>
<li> Define a route to retrieve all meetings (/meetings) using the HTTP GET method </li>
<li> In the route handler, use the find() method of the Meeting model to retrieve all meetings from the database </li>
<li> Return a success response with the retrieved meetings array and HTTP status 200 </li>
<li> Start the server on port 3000 and listen for incoming requests </li>
<li> It's important to note that the code requires replacing "YOUR_API_KEY" with a valid API key for the Whereby API. </li>
</ul>

The endpoint for the front-end developer to retrieve the meeting room URL for a specific meeting by its ID is:
`GET /meetings/:id/roomUrl`

The :id parameter in the endpoint should be replaced with the ID of the meeting for which the room URL is being retrieved.
For example, if the ID of the meeting is 1234, the endpoint to retrieve the meeting room URL would be:
`GET /meetings/1234/roomUrl`

When the front-end developer sends a GET request to this endpoint, the backend server will find the meeting with the specified ID in the database, 
retrieve its room URL, and return it in the response as a JSON object with the key roomUrl. 
The front-end developer can then use this URL to start the Whereby video conference.
