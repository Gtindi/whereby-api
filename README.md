<h1> Whereby API</h1>1>
The code is a Node.js application that creates a RESTful API for managing meetings. It defines a few routes for creating and retrieving meetings using MongoDB for persistence and the Whereby API for generating unique meeting room URLs.

Here is a brief overview of what the code does:

Import necessary modules - Express, Mongoose, and fetch
Connect to the MongoDB instance on port 27017
Define a meeting schema for storing meeting details in the database
Create a model for the Meeting schema
Define an async function called getMeetingRoomUrl() to fetch a unique meeting room URL from the Whereby API
Define a route to create a new meeting (/meetings) using the HTTP POST method
In the route handler, call getMeetingRoomUrl() to fetch a unique meeting room URL from Whereby API
Create a new Meeting instance using the request body and the meeting room URL fetched from the API
Save the new meeting to the database using the save() method
Return a success response with the created meeting object and HTTP status 201
Define a route to retrieve all meetings (/meetings) using the HTTP GET method
In the route handler, use the find() method of the Meeting model to retrieve all meetings from the database
Return a success response with the retrieved meetings array and HTTP status 200
Start the server on port 3000 and listen for incoming requests
It's important to note that the code requires replacing "YOUR_API_KEY" with a valid API key for the Whereby API.
